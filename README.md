Some of this was copied from somewhere around 199x and modified heavily a lot since then. 
It sends batches of alphanumeric messages to alpha pages using the TAP protocol. 
It was part of a system called "ePageMe.com" that worked for many years and is still be using
by a few remaining alphanumberic pager companies worldwide. 
Once upon a time I made many thousands of dollars with this code.
I'm mostly trying to play with Github and thought I would share some old but potentially useful code.
